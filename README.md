A collection of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence projects demonstrating various ML techniques and real-world applications.

## Projects

### PROJECT-01: ML for Real Estate Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts real estate prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The project implements multiple regression models and compares their performance.

**Features:**
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Train-test splitting with stratified sampling
- Feature engineering and correlation analysis
- Multiple ML models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Model evaluation using RMSE and cross-validation
- Model persistence using joblib

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset:**
The project uses the Boston Housing dataset with 14 features including:
- CRIM: Per capita crime rate
- RM: Average number of rooms
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- MEDV: Median value of homes (target variable)
- And more...

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

### Running the Project
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Open the Jupyter notebook or run the Python script
3. Follow the analysis and model training steps
